### **Project Description: Restaurant Order Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from a fictional international cuisine restaurant, using one quarterâ€™s worth of order records. The goal is to uncover actionable insights into menu performance and customer ordering behavior to support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis is structured around three core objectives:

1. **Menu Item Exploration:**  
   The project begins with an in-depth analysis of the `menu_items` table to understand the structure and pricing of menu offerings. This includes identifying the number of items, pinpointing the least and most expensive menu entries, and examining pricing patterns within different cuisine categories.

2. **Order Pattern Analysis:**  
   Next, the `order_details` table is explored to uncover ordering trends. This involves analyzing the range of order dates, calculating the number of items per order, and identifying orders with unusually high item counts.

3. **Customer Behavior & Sales Insights:**  
   By merging the items and orders data, the final objective is to examine customer preferences and spending habits. This includes determining the most and least ordered cuisine categories, as well as breaking down the composition and value of the highest-spending orders.

This project demonstrates how data analysis can be applied to optimize restaurant operations, refine menu offerings, and better understand customer behavior, all through structured SQL querying and interpretation.
